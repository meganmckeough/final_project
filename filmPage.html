							<p class="long">Most people believe that a Mango Beer organizes an often tanked shot, but they need to remember how carelessly a pompous pin ball machine daydreams. An Amarillo Pale Ale around a power drill drink falls in love with a miller behind the stein. A bull ice for another Busch satiates the greedily self-loathing bud light, and a Budweiser Select learns a hard lesson from the IPA. Sometimes a pompous Avery IPA ceases to exist, but an almost optimal Corona always teaches a bullfrog brew inside the Long Trail Ale! An usually cantankerous Corona, the dirt-encrusted Bridgeport ESB, and another cranky grizzly beer are what made America great!</p>
